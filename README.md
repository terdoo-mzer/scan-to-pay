# PWA Project - Scan To Pay


### About the project
Scan to Pay is a Progressive Web App built to disrupt the erstwhile stressful shopping experience of Shoppers. It is normal to have a customer fill their cart, then queue to make payments at the cashier. This process costs both the customers and the businesses. As there might be a lot of shoppers needing to complete their purchases thus unncessarily delaying the rest. Some customers may not be patient enough to wait and thus have to abandon cart. This cost the businesses in the long run as they lose customers.

Scan to pay essentially empowers the customer to literally pick items, scan them with an app provided for donload by the store, make payments on the app and walk out. This enhances customer experience and consequently increase customer retainership by the business.
